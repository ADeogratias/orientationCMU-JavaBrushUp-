Question 2 of the F2F exercise is giving us the following:

int data = 10;
public void changeData(int value) {
    value += 50;
}

And the question is asking for the value of 'data' after
making the following method call:

    changeData(data);

***** Answer *****

This is a pass by value and a copy of the actual parameter's 
value will be made in the memory.

Therefore, the value of of variable 'data' will not change.
The value of data will be 10 after making this method call.
